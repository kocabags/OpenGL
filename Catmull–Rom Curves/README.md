Instructions:

 * The goal of this project is to create an animated scene of Catmull-Rom curves.

 1. It must be in 3D (i.e., Z cannot be constant).

 2. You must have at least 5 curves.
 
 3. Each curve can have any number of points defining it (>=6).

 4. Pick a reasonable number of vertices for each sub-curve so that it looks smooth as t goes from 0. to 1.

 5. The curves must somehow be "different" from each other. That could mean rotated, scaled, different points, etc. But, just translated is not good enough.
 
**************

Requirements: 

 1. Create a scene of at least five 3D Catmull-Rom curves.
 
 2. What the scene looks like is up to you. 10 of the 100 project points are given if you deliberately make it look like something at least somewhat recognizable.

 3. How you color the scene is up to you. (It is helpful to us if each curve is a different color.)

 4. How you animate the scene is up to you.

 5. How many vertices you use to draw each curve is up to you. (I.e., the Î”t.) But, use enough to make the curves look smooth.

 6. Animate each curve by changing the position of one (or more) points per curve based on the Time variable you have been creating in the last couple of projects.

 7. Be able to turn the control points on and off.

 8. Be able to turn the control lines on and off.
 
 9. Enable the following keys:

| Key	| Description |
| --- | ----------- |
| 'f'	| Freese/un-freeze the animation |
